Challenge Description

Perpetual Protocol is a decentralized protocol for trading perpetual futures contracts. Like Uniswap, traders can trade with our vAMMs directly without the need for counter-parties. The vAMMs provide guaranteed on-chain liquidity with predictable pricing set by constant product curves. The vAMMs are also designed to be market neutral and fully collateralized.

We're looking for three general areas that will help traders and users on Perpetual Protocol. We are completely open to how and what you want to build - surprise us! 

Business Solutions and Integrations: this covers anything that utilises Perp as a base layer. 

Tooling: any tooling that may be helpful for either makers, takers, traders or token holders.

Marketing: Anything that focuses on explaining Perp and how it works as well as getting the word out to the community. This can be anything from design to written content! We're open to getting the word out to the community!

Production ready - is this submission something we can include right now?

Quality of the code - is it something that others can pick up? Is it documented/commented clearly?

Is the code working?

Is there a working demo?

How confident are you that the team will stay engaged (on this or other projects) in the community?
